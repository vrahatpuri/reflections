How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I have the confidence to not lose the work I did in my last iteration. Experiment with the new changes without being afraid
	

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can commit logical pieces of work yourself with out over commiting to the repository

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This is because multiple files can constitute one logical piece of work and can be grouped together as a unit that makes Git more powerful.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives you the histroy of the commits that were made for the entire history of the project
	git diff can be used to compare against versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can experiment with new ideas by committing my old implementation and work on the new idea if it breaks or doesn't workout all I have to do is revert back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to version my java code and be a master at versioning my code base. I have struggled a lot by not having this knowledge for many years.
